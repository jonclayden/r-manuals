This repository contains the source code used to generate the mirrors of the [R](http://www.r-project.org) manuals currently hosted at <http://r-manuals.flakery.org>. A local copy of the HTML manuals can be generated by running

    make fetch

to fetch the original manuals (which will have a `.html.in` extension), followed by

    make

to create the new versions (with a `.html` extension). The latter step requires [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and the [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) Ruby gem.

The changes made to the originals are very minimal: existing style tags are stripped out, a new link to the stylesheet provided is inserted, and JavaScript code is injected to support automatic hyphenation. The intention is to make the manuals easier to read and navigate, without altering their primary content.
