<p>This web site provides a mirror of the key documentation for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R project</a>. These versions of the manuals are created primarily by the injection of a new visual style for readability and ease of navigation. Other modification is extremely minimal, but the canonical versions of these manuals are always those available through <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html">CRAN</a>. All of this material is edited by the R Core Team.</p>

<p>The manuals available are as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="R-intro.html">An introduction to R</a> is based on the former "Notes on R", and gives an introduction to the language and how to use R for doing statistical analysis and graphics.</li>
  <li><a href="R-lang.html">The R language definition</a> documents the language <i>per se</i>. That is, the objects that it works on, and the details of the expression evaluation process, which are useful to know when programming R functions.</li>
  <li><a href="R-exts.html">Writing R extensions</a> covers how to create your own packages, write R help files, and use the foreign language (C, C++, Fortran, ...) interfaces.</li>
  <li><a href="R-data.html">R data import/export</a> describes the import and export facilities available either in R itself or via packages which are available from CRAN.</li>
  <li><a href="R-admin.html">R installation and administration</a> covers the installation and administration of R on various platforms.</li>
  <li><a href="R-ints.html">R Internals</a> is a guide to the internal structures of R and coding standards for the core team working on R itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the latex or texinfo sources of the latest version of these documents are contained in every R source distribution (in the subdirectory <code>doc/manual</code> of the extracted archive). Older versions of the manual can be found in the respective archives of the R sources. The HTML versions of the manuals are also part of most R installations (accessible using function <code>help.start()</code>).</p>

<p>Only English versions of the manuals are available on this site. For translations and other additional documentation, please see the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html">contributed documentation</a> section on CRAN.</p>

<p>Source code for the scripts used to generate this web site can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jonclayden/r-manuals">GitHub</a>.</p>
